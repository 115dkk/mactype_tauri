//! A private real-time ETW session over the kernel's process-start events.
//!
//! WMI delivers `Win32_ProcessStartTrace` through a shared real-time session
//! whose buffers flush about once a second, so a program has already painted
//! its first frames by the time the service hears about it. Subscribing to
//! `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process` directly, with a millisecond flush timer,
//! removes that wait.
//!
//! Callers get process identifiers over a bounded channel and an owned type
//! whose destructor stops the session; no trace handle, event record, or
//! payload pointer leaves this module.
